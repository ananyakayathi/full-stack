        <h3>Mount Everest</h3>
        Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced
        mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the
        summit from the southeast in Nepal (known as the standard route) and the
        other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical
        climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such
        as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from
        avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of May 2024, 340 people have died
        on Everest.

      <h3>More Information</h3>
      The British geographic survey of 1849 attempted to preserve local names
      when possible (e.g., Kangchenjunga and Dhaulagiri.) However, Andrew Waugh,
      the British Surveyor General of India, claimed that he could not find a
      commonly used local name, and that his search for one had been hampered by
      the Nepalese and Tibetan policy of exclusion of foreigners. Waugh argued
      that because there were many local names it would be difficult to favour
      one name over all others; he therefore decided that Peak XV should be
      named after British surveyor Sir George Everest, his predecessor as
      Surveyor General of India.[21][22][23] Everest himself opposed the honor,
      and told the Royal Geographical Society in 1857 that "Everest" could
      neither be written in Hindi nor pronounced by "the native of India".
      Despite Everest's objections, Waugh's proposed name prevailed, and the
      Royal Geographical Society officially adopted the name "Mount Everest" in
      1865.[21][24] The modern pronunciation of Everest is different from Sir
      George's pronunciation of his surname.

        <h3>Beach</h3>
        A beach is a landform alongside a body of water which consists of loose
        particles. The particles composing a beach are typically made from rock,
        such as sand, gravel, shingle, pebbles, etc., or biological sources,
        such as mollusc shells or coralline algae. Sediments settle in different
        densities and structures, depending on the local wave action and
        weather, creating different textures, colors and gradients or layers of
        material.
